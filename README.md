## Introduction
Climate change is a huge challenge worldwide and has gained more attention in recent.
The global cause to stop climate change or at least slow it down often focuses on global warming, like the
[Paris climate agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement),
which legally binds the 196 parties “to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels”.

Among various other contributors to global warming, burning fossil fuels for energy consumption stands out as
a primary factor to this day.
When burning fossil fuels, substantial amounts of greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere,
which increase the so-called greenhouse effect, in turn accelerating global warming and climate change.
Facing the amount of greenhouse gases produced by the energy sector, many countries — including countries of
the European Union (EU) — intensified their efforts to transition towards more sustainable energy sources.

This report aims to explore the aforementioned relationship between energy consumption and net greenhouse gas
emissions across countries of the EU, in order to show how they are interconnected.
Furthermore, this report is set to discover how this connection is influenced by the share of renewable energy sources
in the energy pool of a country. This might help to indicate, how effective the adoption of renewable energy sources is
in fighting climate change.

The resulting core questions are:
1. How does the amount of energy consumed influence the net greenhouse gas emissions of European countries?
2. , And how is this influenced by the share of renewables in total energy?

## Description
This project is aimed at answering the two aforementioned questions with open data from the European data portal
[Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat).
The datasets used include data about net greenhouse gas emissions, primary energy consumption and the share of
renewable energy sources of European countries.

- The aim of the project is documented in the [project plan](project/project-plan.md)
- The used data from Eurostat is discussed in the [data report](project/data-report.pdf)
- The data is analyzed, and the questions get answered in the final [analysis report](project/analysis-report.pdf)
